Update, i'm using my super obfuscator now lel
=====
These names MUST disappear to prevent any external modules from using them

I'm using XVI32 hex editor to do it.

Obfuscation method:
Count the characters this name has, then add+1 (previous char is char count including 00 end char).
Remove the name and it's previous char (counter).
There will be 6 other chars after that starting with 00,
Make sure that sequence is 00 00 00 07 00 01
After that sequence there's another name so be careful.

Important
EVERY SINGLE TIME you remove a character, count it

After you finished counting, you must enlarge some critical names
There's 2 functions we must protect which are ffSendHit and ffNoHit.
The sum of characters should be 24 in this case.
Find these 2 names, add between the both random gibberish control chars (1-20, 80-0A) all remaining 24 chars.
Then alter the char counter on each so that the name size isn't wrong.
This should be it.


============>
Repeat process for every name, and keep adding the removed chars to your counter.

Now we must do the reverse process, find bogus1,2,etc names and add characters to them.
These names must be unique or we'll get a crash.
For every char you add to the bogus names, remember to sum to the char counter in front of it.
(07 is counter, 62 6F 67 75 73 31 is the name)

Let's add 18 chars to bogus1.  > bogusaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa1. use the Insert char function to do it.
And add 18(dec) to the counter, remember, result has to be in (HEX) representation.
In this case it is (17 62 6F 67 75.................)

And should be it, if it crashes, you did something wrong
